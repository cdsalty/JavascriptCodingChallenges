      Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for
      sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come
      out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking
      about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one.
      Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's
      funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?
      Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them!
      It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the
      surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover
      for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack
      run. The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those
      transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted
      no transmissions. Aaah.... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If
      this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart
      until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There
      she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
      What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not
      look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special
      modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out
      of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship!
      Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space
      travel. Run, Luke! Run!
